TODO:

- [x] working base algo
- [x] detect if inserting from reverse order is shorter 
- [ ] ability to copy / revert stack in order to test multiple strategies path
- [ ] use swap when inserting on B stack (so that later we may merge sa/sb in ss instructions)
- [ ] split compliations in 2 independant stacks, and sort stakcs one instruction for each per frame, so that we could optimise using ss/rr/rrr
